## How to Run/Use
- Clone/Download repository
- cd into repository in a command line tool (e.g. cmder)
- pip/conda install all necessary packages depending on command line tool you prefer to use. (e.g. conda install keras)
- cd into Web Application directory.
- Run command: python flaskapp.py 
- (Note this is when youll be prompted to install necessary packages if you don't have them installed)
- Navigate to the url link provided by the flask server in a brower (http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
